# typesafe-client

Unofficial **Go** and **Rust** clients for the [TypeSafe AI](https://typesafe.ai)
System One API. System One models, including TypeSafe's flagship model **Jev**,
evaluate text or JSON *state* against named, typed questions and return structured
answers instead of generated text:

| Question | Answers | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| **Noul** | Is this true? | probability of yes |
| **Choice** | Which of these options? | chosen option, a probability per option, confidence |
| **Score** | Which level on this scale? | probability-weighted level, a probability per level, confidence |

| Language | Directory | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Go (1.22+, stdlib only) | [`go/`](go) | `go get github.com/haileyok/typesafe-client/go@latest` ([pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/haileyok/typesafe-client/go)) |
| Rust (async, reqwest, 1.88+) | [`rust/`](rust) | `cargo add typesafe-system-one` ([crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/typesafe-system-one), [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/typesafe-system-one)) |

TypeSafe publishes official SDKs for [Python](https://github.com/typesafe-ai/typesafe-sdk-python)
and [JavaScript/TypeScript](https://github.com/typesafe-ai/typesafe-sdk-js). These
clients bring the same behavior to Go and Rust:

- Typed questions and answers. Structured (JSON) instructions and criteria work,
  and Choice options keep the order you give them
- Configuration from `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, `TYPESAFE_BASE_URL`, `TYPESAFE_DEFAULT_MODEL`,
  and `TYPESAFE_LOG_LEVEL`
- The official SDKs' retry policy: 408/429/5xx (including 529 Overloaded), connection
  failures, and timeouts, retried with exponential backoff and jitter. `Retry-After`
  is honored, and a total budget returns the last *real* error rather than a synthetic
  timeout
- Typed errors per status, with server messages extracted (including FastAPI 422 field
  paths) and the `x-typesafe-request-id` attached
- Response validation with dotted field paths. Future answer types are passed
  through instead of breaking the response
- `GET /v1/models`, gateway support (OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway, your own proxy), and
  logging with credentials redacted

> **OpenJEV support:** Jev is built by [TypeSafe](https://typesafe.ai). This fork keeps TypeSafe as the default and adds optional support for [OpenJEV](https://openjev.sh), a free community gateway to the same Jev model — set `OPENJEV_API_KEY` (or `JEV_PROVIDER=openjev`) to use it. Original project: https://github.com/haileyok/typesafe-client by @haileyok.

## Getting started

Both clients read your API key from `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`. Create one in the
[TypeSafe console](https://console.typesafe.ai/keys).

### Go

```sh
go get github.com/haileyok/typesafe-client/go@latest
```

The import path ends in `/go`, but the package is named `typesafe`:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	typesafe "github.com/haileyok/typesafe-client/go"
)

func main() {
	client, err := typesafe.NewClient() // reads TYPESAFE_API_KEY
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	resp, err := client.SystemOne(context.Background(), typesafe.Request{
		State: "Help! My payouts have been failing for 3 days.",
		Questions: typesafe.Questions{
			"is_urgent":  typesafe.Noul("Does this convey urgency?"),
			"department": typesafe.ChoiceNames("Which team should handle this?", "billing", "technical", "sales"),
		},
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	urgent, _ := resp.Noul("is_urgent")
	dept, _ := resp.Choice("department")
	fmt.Printf("urgent=%.2f department=%s (confidence %.2f)\n", urgent.Noul, dept.Choice, dept.Confidence)
}
```

See the [Go README](go/README.md) for the full guide and
[pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/haileyok/typesafe-client/go) for the API reference.

### Rust

The client is async, so add tokio alongside it:

```sh
cargo add typesafe-system-one
cargo add tokio --features macros,rt-multi-thread
```

The crate is imported as `typesafe_system_one`:

```rust
use typesafe_system_one::{Choice, Client, Error, Noul, SystemOneRequest};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let client = Client::from_env()?; // reads TYPESAFE_API_KEY
    let resp = client
        .system_one(
            SystemOneRequest::new("Help! My payouts have been failing for 3 days.")
                .question("is_urgent", Noul::new("Does this convey urgency?"))
                .question(
                    "department",
                    Choice::from_options("Which team should handle this?", ["billing", "technical", "sales"]),
                ),
        )
        .await?;
    let urgent = resp.noul("is_urgent").expect("asked is_urgent");
    let dept = resp.choice("department").expect("asked department");
    println!("urgent={:.2} department={} (confidence {:.2})", urgent.noul, dept.choice, dept.confidence);
    Ok(())
}
```

See the [Rust README](rust/README.md) for the full guide and
[docs.rs](https://docs.rs/typesafe-system-one) for the API reference.

## Behavior contract

[`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) defines what both clients do: configuration, headers,
validation, decoding, errors, retries, and logging. It also records how
disagreements between the docs, the OpenAPI spec, and the official SDKs were
resolved. [`spec/openapi.json`](spec/openapi.json) is a snapshot of TypeSafe's
published OpenAPI document (API v0.2.0) that the clients are tested against.

Tips for using the API well, from TypeSafe's docs:

- **Ask every question about a state in one request.** Questions run in parallel and
  independently, so extra (even speculative) questions barely change latency.
- **Question IDs aren't sent to the model.** Write the full question in the instructions.
- **Use `confidence` to decide when to act**, and tune thresholds on your own data.
  Pin a versioned model (e.g. `jev-1.13.0`) once you do, because aliases move.
- **Keep math, counting, and date arithmetic in code.** See
  [Jev jaggedness](https://docs.typesafe.ai/model-jaggedness/jev-1.13).

## Releases

Each client is versioned independently: `go/vX.Y.Z` tags release the Go
module and `rust/vX.Y.Z` tags release the crate. See [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).
